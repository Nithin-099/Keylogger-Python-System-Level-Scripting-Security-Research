## Keylogger — Python System-Level Scripting & Security Research

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how keystroke logging mechanisms function at a technical level using Python. The objective is to understand how malicious keyloggers operate in order to develop better defensive security strategies.

⚠️ Developed strictly in a controlled lab environment for cybersecurity education and defensive research.


🎯 Objectives

● Understand how keylogging techniques work

● Demonstrate user input capture mechanisms

● Analyze potential security risks

● Study defensive detection techniques

🛠 Technologies Used

● Python 3

● pynput library (if used)

● logging module

● OS file handling

⚙️ Features

● Captures keyboard inputs

● Stores logs in structured format

● Timestamp logging

● Background execution simulation 


🧠 How It Works

1.Listens for keyboard input events

2.Captures keystrokes using system hooks

3.Logs input data into a file

4.Stores timestamps for activity tracking

🔐 Security Implications

Keystroke logging can be used maliciously to:

● Steal credentials

● Capture sensitive information

● Monitor user behavior without consent
 
Understanding these techniques helps security professionals:
● Detect malicious software

● Implement endpoint protection

● Design behavioral monitoring systems


🛡 Defensive Measures

● Use updated antivirus & EDR solutions

● Monitor suspicious background processes

● Restrict administrative privileges

● Enable OS-level input protection mechanisms
